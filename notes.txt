Start ---
- npm init
- npm install —save express
- index.js - the root file
- Node only has support for common js files
- Node doesn’t have support for es2015 modules - “import express from express”

Heroku deployment checklist for Node ---
Dynamic port binding
- heroku will tell us what port we need to be listening on
Specify Node Environment
Specify a start script 
Create .gitignore file
- don't commit any dependencies we've installed (node modules)
- traditional we don't commit these dependencies
- we'll have heroku install these
- so add "node modules" to .gitignore
